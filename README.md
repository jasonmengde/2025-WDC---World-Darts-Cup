Tournament Format: At the beginning, all players compete in a knockout system. The tournament bracket will be generated automatically and released.

# How and What Will Be Played?
The number of "Best of Legs" will be determined based on the number of participants and communicated accordingly. The "home player" is responsible for contacting their opponent to play the match. If the "guest player" does not receive an invitation, they should attempt to make contact. If no communication occurs in either direction, please contact the tournament organiser. A coin toss is always required!

# Fair Play Rules
The "Fair Play Rules" emphasise honest score entry and adherence to general (PDC) dart regulations, forming the foundation for a fair and smooth competition. Each player is responsible for accurately entering their actual scores. Intentional manipulation of results, such as entering incorrect scores, is considered unsportsmanlike behaviour. Additionally, external interference in the game by third parties is strictly prohibitedâ€”each player must play independently without physical assistance. These rules ensure that all participants compete under equal conditions.
The tournament must also be played without cameras to maintain uniform conditions for all participants. But if you both have a camera, you are welcome to use it. Alongside accurate score entry, respectful behaviour is expected. Any insults or unsportsmanlike conduct, such as deliberately delaying the game, are prohibited and should be reported to the tournament organiser if they occur. These rules ensure a respectful and fair atmosphere throughout the competition.

# General Notes
To avoid delays or similar issues, please keep an eye on the tournament chat on the website at all times.
